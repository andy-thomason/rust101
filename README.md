# Rust 101

Rust 101 is a short course on Rust programming presented
as a series of social media posts on LinkedIn, Bluesky and X.

For more depth, Amy can present a three day course in Rust programming
for your team. Courses are presented using live coding - no slides.
We can also run pro bono sessions for groups and meetups.

We can address:

* Network and async programming
* Embedded systems

And many other topics.

Amy runs the Oxford Rust meetup, which meets at the St. Aldates tavern
