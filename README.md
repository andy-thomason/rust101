# Rust 101

Rust 101 is a short course on Rust programming presented
as a series of social media posts on LinkedIn, Bluesky and X.

For more depth, Amy or one of our other trainers can present
a three day course in Rust programming for your team. Courses
are presented using live coding - no slides.

We can also run pro bono sessions for groups and meetups.

We can address:

* Network and async programming
* Embedded systems
* Blockchain programming in Rust
* Data science in Rust
* Compiler theory
* Game development in Rust
* Bioinformatics in Rust

And many other topics.

Amy runs the Oxford Rust meetup, which meets at the St. Aldates tavern
in Oxford the first wednesday of every month.

Rust101 showcases training material from Amy's course.

## Overview

This short course is composed of the following sections

* [Rust basics](doc/00-Rust-Basics.md) - integer types, floating point, usize, str & references.
* [Structures](doc/01-Structures.md) - C-like, tuple structs, tuples and access via "."
* [Heap and stack](doc/02-HeapAndStack.md) - how variables in Rust are created.
* [String](doc/03-String.md) - The `String` growable container and `Box<str>`
* [Vec](doc/04-Vec.md) - The `Vec` growable array and `Box<[T]>`
* [Expressions 1](doc/05-Expressions1.md) - everything's an expression and `{ expr }`
* [References](doc/06-References.md) - like pointers, but safer.
* [Safety](doc/06-References.md) - avoiding dangling pointers.
* [Printing](doc/07-Safety.md) - using the `println!()` macro.
* [Enums](doc/09-Enums.md) - how to store choices.
* [Option](doc/10-Option.md) - to be or not to be.
* [Result 1](doc/11-Result1.md) - the `Result` type vs exceptions.
* [Result 2](doc/12-Result2.md) - using `enum` for errors.
* [Move semantics](doc/13-MoveSemantics.md) - no automatic copies for some types.
* [Reference Rules](doc/14-ReferenceRules.md) - don't cross the streams!
* [Lifetimes 1](doc/15-Lifetimes.md) - dangling pointers again.
* [Lifetimes 2](doc/16-Lifetimes2.md) - annotations and *lifetime washing*
* [Lifetimes 3](doc/17-Lifetimes3.md) - lifetimes in structs.
